/**
 *
 * Here we are copying and rolling our own Foundation scss source file from `~foundation-sites/scss/foundation.scss`.
 * After copying this source file, we updated the paths to target the `node_modules` directory by prefixing scss
 * file imports using `~`.
 *
 * This gives more control over individual components and avoids polluting the
 * scss namespace with unused variables reducing the chance for collisions with other frameworks.
 *
 * For the purposes of this project, we are only interested in the Foundation grid and nothing else.
